Got it 👍 you want to **move the APK to your Android device first**, then install it manually (like by tapping it in the device’s file explorer).

Here’s the **step-by-step way** to do that:

---

### 1. Build the APK

You already did this:

```bash
./gradlew clean assembleDebug
```

Your APK is here:
`app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

---

### 2. Connect your device

Check connection:

```bash
adb devices
```

(make sure your device shows as `device`)

---

### 3. Push APK to your Android device

Choose a folder on your phone (like **Downloads**). Run:

```bash
adb push app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk /sdcard/Download/
```

This copies the APK into your phone’s **Download** folder.

---

### 4. Open it manually on the device

* On your Android device, go to **Files** or **My Files** → **Download**.
* Tap `app-debug.apk`.
* Android will ask for install permissions → allow it → app installs.

---

✅ This way you don’t rely on `adb install`.
You can also use this for **release APK** once you sign it.

Do you want me to also show you how to **generate a signed release APK** so you can install it without that “NO\_CERTIFICATES” error?
